## Hi there 👋

I'm Michael, a Full-Stack Developer based in London.

I design and build whatever projects interest me.

My main tech stack is React, Typescript, node and python.

I've got a lot of projects but my favourite is my AI fruit classification project [(QualityLens)](https://github.com/Mickman7/QualityLens).

I started coding in 2019 and since i have completed my Bachlors in Computer Science and am currently doing a Masters in Artificial Intelligence.
